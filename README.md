# My Custom Functions

**Free WordPress Plugin**

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily and safely add your custom functions (PHP code) for execution in the WordPress environment directly out of your WordPress Admin Area, without the need to have an external editor.

This is a simple and perfect tool to use as your website's functionality plugin. Its purpose is to provide a familiar experience to WordPress users. There is no need for any more editing of the functions.php file of your theme. Just add your custom PHP code in the field on the plugin page and this plugin will do the rest for you.

The plugin works completely independently of the theme, so you can use it with any theme, and regardless of whether the theme does or does not have a functions.php file. The code you place on the plugin page will be entirely unaffected if you edit the contents of the theme’s functions.php file, or even completely change the theme. This is really useful in case of updating theme or plugins, because your custom PHP code would never be overwritten. Your custom PHP code will keep on working, no matter how many times you upgrade or switch your theme and plugins.

On the plugin page you find the code editor powered by CodeMirror. This code editor has options such as syntax highlighting, line numbering, and more. And if you want more options, let us know and we will be happy to add them.
