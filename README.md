**Free Premium WordPress Plugin**

![screenshot](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/my-custom-functions/blob/master/assets/banner-772x250.png)

An easy to use WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily and safely add your custom functions (PHP code) for execution in the WordPress environment directly out of your WordPress Dashboard and without any need for an external editor. 

Its purpose is to provide a familiar experience to WordPress users. No need for any more editing of the functions.php file of your theme. Just add your PHP code in the field on the plugin page and this plugin will do the rest for you.

This is a simple and perfect tool to use as your site's functionality plugin.

It's really useful in case of any theme update, because your custom PHP code would never be overwritten. Your custom PHP code will keep on working, no matter how many times you upgrade or switch your theme.

On the plugin page you find the PHP editor powered by CodeMirror. It has syntax highlighting and line numbering options. Also this editor supports a tab indentation.
