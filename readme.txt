Easily and safely add your custom PHP code to your WordPress website, directly out of the WordPress Admin Area, without the need to have an external editor.


== Description ==

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily and safely add your custom PHP code to your WordPress website, directly out of the WordPress Admin Area, without the need to have an external editor.

This is a simple and perfect tool to use as your website's functionality plugin. This is a must have tool for authors and website's owners. Its purpose is to provide a familiar experience to WordPress users. There is no need for any more editing of the functions.php file of your theme or any of your plugin files for to add custom PHP code. Just add your custom PHP code in the field on the plugin page and this plugin will do the rest for you. It will automatically add your PHP code to your website, without changing any of your theme files and without slowing down your website.

The plugin works completely independently of the theme, so you can use it with any theme, and regardless of whether the theme does or does not have a functions.php file. The code you place on the plugin page will be entirely unaffected if you edit the contents of the theme’s functions.php file, or even completely change the theme. This is really useful in case of updating theme or plugins, because your custom PHP code would never be overwritten. Your custom PHP code will keep on working, no matter how many times you upgrade or switch your theme and plugins.

On the plugin page you find the code editor powered by CodeMirror. This code editor has options such as syntax highlighting, line numbering, and more. And if you want more options, let us know and we will be happy to add them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Will this plugin work on my wordpress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (wordpress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. This plugin is ready for translation and has already been translated into several languages. But If your language is not available then you can make one. It is also possible that not all existing translations are up-to-date or correct, so you are welcome to make corrections. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you share your translation with the community. Thanks for your contribution!

If you want to help translate this plugin, please use the POT file that is included and placed in the `languages` folder to create a translation PO file. Just [send the PO file to us](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and we will include this translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, place your custom PHP code in the code editor field, switch the toggle to the "ON" position and click the "Save changes" button. Enjoy the result of applying your custom PHP code. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WordPress Admin Area`" -> "`Settings`" -> "`PHP Inserter`".

= Q. Can I use HTML/CSS/JS code integrated in PHP code? =
A. Yes. But you need to do it properly, like this:

`function my_custom_html_code() {

    // Print the custom HTML code
    echo '<script>YOUR CUSTOM HTML CODE HERE</script>';

}
add_action( 'wp_head', 'my_custom_html_code' );`

= Q. How much of PHP code (characters) I can enter in the code editor? =
A. We don't limit the number of characters.

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Area of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page. But you need to know the HTML or CSS in order to add/remove/modify the HTML or CSS code by using this plugin.

= Q. Can I add my custom PHP code to a specific page of my website? =
A. For now, this plugin does not have an option to apply the custom PHP code only on specific pages. We plan to add this feature soon. But for now in order to apply your custom PHP code only on specific pages of your website, you need to wrap your custom PHP code in a PHP function that will determine the page you want. You need something like this:

`function my_custom_php_code() {

    // Stop the function if this is not the Home page of website
    if ( !is_home() ) {
        return;
    }

    // YOUR CUSTOM PHP CODE HERE

}
my_custom_php_code();`

= Q. On the plugin settings page, an error message appears. What could be wrong? =
A. Here are a few of the most likely causes of the error message:

1. You make a syntax error in the code that you have entered. Check the syntax of your code and try again.
2. You entered two functions with the same name. Use a unique names for your functions.
3. You have entered function with a name that is already occupied by another function. Use a unique name for your function.
4. You are trying to overwrite an existing function (of WordPress, theme, or plugin). Instead, use filters and hooks.

= Q. My custom PHP code is not working. What could be wrong? =
A. It happens that your custom PHP code that you insert on the plugin page does not work, even if an error message does not appear. Here are a few of the most likely causes of the issue:

1. You have a typo during the insertion of your custom PHP code.
2. Your custom PHP code has a syntax error.
3. Your custom PHP code is incorrect and may not work.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly. The most common reason for this is a web browser’s cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser’s cache. Clearing your browser’s cache may solve the problem.

If you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, we'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. What to do if this plugin crashed the website? =
A. This plugin has a built-in functions for checking the custom code for syntax errors, duplicate functions names, and etc. But plugin is not perfect, so there are times when the entered custom code causes the error and white screen (WSOD). This is due to the fact that your custom code has a syntax error that this plugin could not detect. When this happens with you, please perform the following steps.

1. Access your server via FTP or SFTP. If you aren’t sure how usually your web hosting provider will have instructions somewhere on their website.
2. Browse to the directory `wp-content/plugins/my-custom-functions/`. Please contact your web hosting company to get help if you can't find this folder.
3. Rename the file `START` to `STOP`. This will stop the execution of your custom code.
4. Log in to Admin Area of your WordPress website.
5. Go to the plugin settings page `Settings` -> `PHP Inserter`.
6. Edit/fix your custom PHP code that you entered before the crash.
7. Return to the plugin folder and rename the file `STOP` to `START` and you're done!

This plugin stored you entered code in the database of your website. For getting your code, you also can go to the `Database` -> Table "`wp_options`" -> Option "`spacexchimp_p001_settings`" -> "`option_value`".

We are already working on a feature to automatically stop the execution of users custom PHP code for cases when this plugin could not detect the error, and this caused the inaccessibility of the website.

= Q. The last WordPress update is preventing me from editing my website that is using this plugin. Why is this? =
A. This plugin can not cause such problem. More likely, the problem are related to the settings of the website. It could just be a cache, so please try to clear your website's cache (may be you using a caching plugin, or some web service such as the CloudFlare) and then the cache of your web browser. Also please try to re-login to the website, this too can help.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Bug reports are very welcome! Please visit [our contact page](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and report. Thank you!

= Q. Where to share any ideas or suggestions to make the plugin better? =
A. Any suggestions are very welcome! Please visit [our contact page](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and share. Thank you!

= Q. I love this plugin! Can I help somehow? =
