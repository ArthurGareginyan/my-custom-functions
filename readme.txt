EASILY and SAFELY add your own functions, snippets or any custom codes directly out of your WordPress Dashboard without need of an external editor.


== Description ==
An easy to use WordPress plugin that lets you EASILY and SAFELY add your own functions, snippets or any custom codes for execution in WordPress environment directly out of your WordPress Dashboard without any need of an external editor. 

It’s purpose is to provide a familiar experience to WordPress users. No need any more editing the functions.php file of your theme. Just add your code in the field on the page and this plugin will do the rest for you.

No any more “Fatal error”. These codes will run safely and will not generate fatal errors, so your website won't break if you make a typo in your code.

And your website will keep on working, no matter how many times you upgrade or switch your theme.

This is a simple and perfect tool to use as your site's functionality plugin.

* Syntax highlighting (by CodeMirror).
* Line numbering (by CodeMirror).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will this Plugin work on my WordPress.com website? =
Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.

I don't limit the number of characters.

Yes. But If your language is not available then you can make one. This plugin is ready for translation. The .pot file is included and placed in "languages" folder. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you shared your translation with the community. Just send the translation files (*.po, *.mo) to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include the translation within the next plugin update.
