# How to contribute

When contributing to "My Custom Functions" you have to follow some conventions and a simple workflow. It allows me to handle the requests quickly and ensure best quality
for the "My Custom Functions" core code.

Following guidelines will result in less work for both you and me. Please take the time and read the following guide from beginning to the end.

- [Submitting bug reports](#submitting-bug-reports-)
- [Contributing code](#contributing-code-)
- [Contributing translations](#contributing-translations-)


## Submitting bug reports

The preferred way to report bugs is to use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/my-custom-functions/issues). Before reporting a bug, read these pointers.

**Note:** The issue tracker is for *bugs*, not requests for help.


### Reporting bugs effectively

- "My Custom Functions" is maintained by me. I don't owe you anything, so be polite. Reports with an indignant or belligerent tone tend to be moved to the bottom of the pile.

- Include information about **the browser in which the problem occurred**. Even if you tested several browsers, and the problem occurred in all of them, mention this fact in the bug report. Also include browser version numbers and the operating system that you're on.

- Mention which release of "My Custom Functions" you're using.

- Mention very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bug report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe the exact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur. We can not fix something that we can not observe.


## Contributing code

- Make sure you have a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Fork [My Custom Functions](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/my-custom-functions)
  ([how to fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo))
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request
([how to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)).
  Don't put more than one feature/fix in a single pull request.

By contributing code to "My Custom Functions" you:

 - agree to license the contributed code under [GNU GPLv3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

 - confirm that you have the right to contribute and license the code
   in question. (Either you hold all rights on the code, or the rights
   holder has explicitly granted the right to use it like this,
   through a compatible open source license or through a direct
   agreement with you.)


#### Line endings

A common issue for many pull requests is inconsistent line endings. You can
learn about dealing with it at: [https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings)


#### Coding standards

- 4 spaces per indentation level, no tabs.


## Contributing translations

Contributing translations does not have a workflow like with code. You don't
need to create an issue, pull request will be enough.


**Thanks for your contribution!**
